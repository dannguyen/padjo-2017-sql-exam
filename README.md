## Instructions

Create a Google Doc named:

Share it with me, and also email it to me.

This Google Doc should have this format:

- One page per question
- First line of the page should be the question number, e.g. A02
- The rest of the page should just be the query that answers the prompt. 
- Put the query in a **monospace** font (such as Courier)
- The query should return *exactly* the expected result, that includes the order and naming of the columns. Don't deviate.
